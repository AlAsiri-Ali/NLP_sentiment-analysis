# Android Galaxy Sentiment Analysis

**ðŸŽ¯ Natural Language Processing project for sentiment classification of Android Galaxy product reviews**

> Built with traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches to classify customer sentiment from Reddit reviews.

## Overview

This project analyzes customer sentiment toward Android Galaxy devices using Natural Language Processing techniques. The system compares traditional machine learning models with deep learning approaches to classify Reddit reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

### Key Features
- **Multiple AI Models**: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and Bidirectional LSTM
- **Real Dataset**: 1,000 authentic Android Galaxy reviews from Reddit
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves 77.5% accuracy with Random Forest model
- **Complete Pipeline**: From raw text preprocessing to final classification

## Results

### Model Performance

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Random Forest** | **77.5%** | 0.78 | 0.77 | 0.77 |
| **Logistic Regression** | 75.2% | 0.75 | 0.75 | 0.75 |
| **SVM (Linear)** | 74.1% | 0.74 | 0.74 | 0.74 |
| **Bidirectional LSTM** | 73.8% | 0.74 | 0.73 | 0.73 |

### Dataset Information
- **Total Reviews**: 1,000 Android Galaxy reviews from Reddit
- **Classes**: Positive, Negative, Neutral
- **Class Distribution**: 75.2% Negative, 17.3% Positive, 7.5% Neutral
- **Data Balancing**: Applied SMOTE upsampling

### Key Insights
- **Best Model**: Random Forest achieves highest accuracy (77.5%)
- **Fastest Training**: Logistic Regression trains in ~5 seconds
- **Deep Learning**: LSTM provides comparable results to traditional methods
- **Feature Analysis**: Words like "amazing", "terrible", "battery life" are most predictive

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from src.traditional_models import train_traditional_models
from src.data_preprocessing import load_and_preprocess_data

# Load and preprocess data
data = load_and_preprocess_data('data/sample_data.csv')

# Train all models
results = train_traditional_models(data)
print(f"Best accuracy: {max(results.values()):.3f}")
```

### Deep Learning Model
```python
from src.deep_learning_model import train_lstm_model

# Train LSTM model
model, history, encoder, tokenizer = train_lstm_model(data)

# Make prediction
new_review = "This Galaxy phone has amazing camera quality!"
prediction = model.predict(new_review)
```
